          Hi! Thanks for visiting my website. My name is Ignacio Prato, borned in Santa Fe and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I would like to introduce myself by sharing my passions, my history and experience. Music is one of my favourite things in life, not just in a fun or idle way, perhaps the inner-connection music brings me is one of the most valuable things I've ever experienced. I started playing music in highschool, sharing songs with friends and learning from each other. <br> At the age of 21 I went to a Musical Institute with a Contemporanean study plan. Months before I started experimenting a strong affinity with the Piano, that's how I joined my first musical project: <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bajobelgranomusic/?theme=dark">"Bajo Belgrano"</a></strong>. Previously was a Power Trio, and it was challenging for me to contribute with the compositions and the structure that was already consolidated. <br>
          While studying at ITMC (Instituto de Musica Contemporanea) I formed a band with some companions and a teacher we had, and we called it "The Chiki Chazz Band", playing Jazz, Latin Jazz, and other popular and known styles. We went on tour to Mar del Plata three summers in a row <br> <br>
